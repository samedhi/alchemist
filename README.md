# Alchemists
This is a trainer to help you improve at the deductive part of Matus Kotry's Alchemists 
board game. This is not a implementation of the game, merely a trainer to help with the 
deductive aspects of it.

#Demo
[http://alchemists-1054.appspot.com/](http://alchemists-1054.appspot.com/)

#Installation
simply clone this project. Then move into the project directory and run `boot dev` to 
start up the development environment. If you need help installing boot (a Clojure build 
system) then look [here](https://github.com/boot-clj/boot). If you need help installing 
Clojure then look [here](http://clojure.org/getting_started).

If you need to build the project, use `boot build`. Although you will not be able to deploy
the code to the hosted server using this. If you push the code back to me though, I will be 
happy to deploy your changes.
